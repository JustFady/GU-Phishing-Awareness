## How to Run the App Locally

### Option 1: Using Docker (recommended)

If you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, just run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build

This builds the docker image, starts the container then hosts locally at http://localhost:5000

### Option 2: Local setup
pip install -r requirements.txt #install dependencies
python app/app.py # run flask app
